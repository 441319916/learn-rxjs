# withLatestFrom
####signature: `withLatestFrom(other: Observable, project: Function): Observable`
*The gist: When source emits, also give last value emitted from another observable...*


### Examples

##### Example 1: Latest value from quicker second source

( [jsBin](http://jsbin.com/fitekeseru/1/edit?js,console) | [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/btroncone/9c3pfgpk/) )

```js
//emit every 5s
const source = Rx.Observable.interval(5000);
//emit every 1s
const secondSource = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
const example = source
  .withLatestFrom(secondSource)
  .map(([first, second]) => {
    return `First Source (5s): ${first} Second Source (1s): ${second}`;
  });
/*
  "First Source (5s): 0 Second Source (1s): 4"
  "First Source (5s): 1 Second Source (1s): 9"
  "First Source (5s): 2 Second Source (1s): 14"
  ...
*/
const subscribe = example.subscribe(val => console.log(val));
```

##### Example 2: Slower second source

( [jsBin](http://jsbin.com/vujekucuxa/1/edit?js,console) | [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/btroncone/bywLL579/) )

```js
//emit every 5s
const source = Rx.Observable.interval(5000);
//emit every 1s
const secondSource = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
//withLatestFrom slower than source
const example = secondSource
  //both sources must emit at least 1 value (5s) before emitting
  .withLatestFrom(source)
  .map(([first, second]) => {
    return `Source (1s): ${first} Latest From (5s): ${second}`;
  });
/*
  "Source (1s): 4 Latest From (5s): 0"
  "Source (1s): 5 Latest From (5s): 0"
  "Source (1s): 6 Latest From (5s): 0"
  ...
*/
const subscribe = example.subscribe(val => console.log(val));
```
